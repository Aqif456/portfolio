  <h1 class="display-4"> Love or Life? </h1>
  <p class="lead">In life, at some point every individual experiences a certain dilemma between love and life! This point in life is one of those very crucial periods in which one has to decide/make the right choice to live life without bringing him/herself at the brink of losing his/her very own self/identity</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
<p>So what is life?? Life basically is the timeline that we live through beginning from the moment when we are born until the moment we die. But in broader sense, life is an infinite array of paths that we walkthrough at different time periods that leads to different possibilities of reality containing numerable probabilities.</p>
<p>Now what is love?? Love is an emotion that every human being has/feels/experiences at some point in life like a strange miracle which happens without anyone predicting/noticing it coming!!</p>
<p>Love or Life?? Life is love but love might not be life. Love is part of life but obviously not our whole life. Life has many other infinite possibilities exclusive of love. Love definitely is a human need. Every individual experiences this particular emotion at certain points in life. But that does not necessarily mean love is an absolute necessity without which an individual might cease to exist. It is a need without the need of which people can survive, live life, give their life any shape they want to as well. Love is just one among many other parts of life. To explain or make it easier for understanding we can consider life as the universe and love being one particle in the universe with many other particles/planets/satellites as the other infinite possibilities in life.</p>
